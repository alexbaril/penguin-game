# **About**
The goal of this project was to create an interactive device which incorporates sensor data. This project is a video game where the user plays as a penguin and tries to eat as many fish before being eaten by a shark. The penguin is controlled via use of a joystick. A potentiometer controls the frequency of the sharks and the button allows the user to restart after the penguin is eaten. The ESP32 is used for collection of sensor data and serial communication.

# **Instructions**
## Breadboarding

1. Follow the Fritzing diagram above when wiring the components. 

2. Before attaching the joystick, button, and potentiometer to the breadboard, you should solder extension wires and M-M header pins to the components. Add heatshrink over these new connections to strengthen them. This is so that the components can easily be attached to the penguin enclosure. I would also recommend adding tape every about half inch so that the extended wires do not get tangled.
