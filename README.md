# **About**
This project is a video game where the user plays as a penguin and tries to eat as many fish before being eaten by a shark. The penguin is controlled via use of a joystick. A potentiometer controls the frequency of the sharks and the button allows the user to restart after the penguin is eaten. The ESP32 is used for collection of sensor data and serial communication.
